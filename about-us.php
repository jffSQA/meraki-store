        From the time she was a little girl, Jennifer Arago was enchanted by the art of design; the process of taking the purest artistic elements and molding them into something extraordinary. Today, as Chief Designer at David Aubrey, she brings that same passion to every piece of jewelry she creates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jennifer was first captivated by the jewelry trade while attending nursing school at night and working as a designer’s apprentice by day. This experience was an awakening of sorts, and she quickly realized that nursing would not fuel her creative fire quite the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognizing her talent, Jennifer’s mother convinced her to start a collection of her pieces. After exhibiting her work in trade shows, Jennifer caught the eye of agents in Atlanta and New York, and David Aubrey Jewelry made its debut in 1996. Generating $3 million in sales in just a few years, she had a revelation: making jewelry was not merely a hobby; it was her career destiny. When David Aubrey outgrew its first studio in Soho, Jennifer moved her team to a larger space in Jersey City, which currently serves as company headquarters.

    <p>
        David Aubrey lines vary from delicate, meticulously assembled jewelry of monochromatic hues to larger, more vibrant pieces. Some collections are themed, whether romantic, vintage, tribal, or art deco. Each piece is painstakingly crafted with an array of raw materials, including plated and oxidized brass and white metal, semiprecious stones, vintage glass beads, Indian handmade glass beads, acrylic, and carved bone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary inspirations behind Jennifer’s designs are texture and color. She says, “Most of the collections start with one finding that excites me. I then gather materials that go beautifully with that first element. The goal is to strike that perfect synergy of shapes, shades, and textures and deliver distinct and unexpected combinations.”
    In styles ranging from sophisticated to whimsical, David Aubrey pieces are timeless—a bold statement for the moment as well as ten years from now. Jennifer is proud of the fact that her designs are revered by everyone from teenagers to octogenarians: “People appreciate our collections not because they are trendy, but because each piece is a work of art in its own right. For me, that is the greatest compliment of all.”

        David Aubrey has amassed a worldwide following, sold in Japan, Dubai, South America, Australia, the Caribbean, and across Europe through stores and catalogs such as Anthropologie, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Boston Proper, ASOS, Fenwick, Gilt, and W Hotels. All pieces are handcrafted in the U.S. by skilled artisans who share Jennifer’s passion for quality and originality.
